This game is an artificial intelligence born in the 60s.

It was made to run without a computer, by using only home materials like matchboxes and some coloured spheres.
This version is based upon the "HER" Hexapawn Educable Robot made by Roberto Rampini, now with c3b3 permitted as first move (release 2.0).

Unfortunately there is a bug on a move (box31) because I can't add the code to handle it due to oversizing 50KB permitted from XC BASIC (see commented box31) code for details.

You will have the possibility to win 7 times here, after the C64 will be unbeatable!
