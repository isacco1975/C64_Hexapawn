This game is an artificial intelligence born in the 60s.

It was made to run without a computer, by using only home materials like matchboxes and some coloured spheres.
This version is based upon the "HER" Hexapawn Educable Robot made by Roberto Rampini: c3b3 move is not permitted as first one.

You will have the possibility to win 7 times here, after the C64 will be unbeatable!
